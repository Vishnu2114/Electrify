This project is an online shopping system built using PHP and MySQL as part of my mini project during my BCA program. It is designed to provide electricians and contractors with a simple, accessible platform to browse, search, and purchase hardware and plumbing equipment.

The platform features user registration and login, product listings categorized by type, a shopping cart system, and a basic checkout process. An admin panel is included to manage products, categories, and user orders. The interface is built using HTML and CSS for a clean, user-friendly experience.

The goal of this project is to simplify the buying process for commonly used electrical and plumbing items, especially for users in the field who need quick access to materials. By offering an organized and responsive system, the platform helps bridge the gap between traditional supply shops and digital convenience.

The system runs locally using XAMPP, and data is stored and managed using MySQL. It can be easily expanded into a fully functional e-commerce solution with added features like payment integration, order history, and delivery tracking.

This project strengthened my skills in backend development, database management, and practical web application design.
